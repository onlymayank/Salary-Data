# Salary Prediction Model

## Overview
Welcome to the Salary Prediction Model repository! This project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to develop a model for predicting salaries based on various features. The goal is to provide accurate salary estimates for individuals, aiding in decision-making processes for both employers and job seekers.

## Data
The project uses a diverse dataset containing information on individuals, including factors such as education, experience, location, and other relevant features. The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the salary prediction model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors influencing salary.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's ability to predict salaries accurately.
4. **Model Development:** Implement machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, to predict salaries based on the features extracted from the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Fine-tune the models for optimal results.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the final model, making it accessible for salary predictions in real-world scenarios.
